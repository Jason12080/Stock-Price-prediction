Stock Price Prediction Project
This project forecasts stock prices using time series analysis, machine learning, and deep learning. By leveraging historical stock data and engineered features, we aim to build predictive models that provide insights into future trends and price movements.

Project Objectives
Predict future stock prices based on historical data.
Compare models for accuracy and robustness.
Explore deep learning models like LSTM and GRU for capturing time series patterns.


Key Features
Data Collection & Preprocessing: Gather historical stock data, including Open, Close, High, Low, Volume, and technical indicators.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Use data visualization to identify trends, seasonality, and correlations.
Modeling: Evaluate prediction methods across:
Baseline Models: Moving averages, ARIMA.
Machine Learning Models: Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests.
Deep Learning Models: LSTMs and GRUs to capture sequential patterns.
Evaluation: Measure model performance with metrics like MSE, MAE, and directional accuracy.
