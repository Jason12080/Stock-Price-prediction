Stock Price Prediction Project
This project aims to forecast stock prices using a combination of time series analysis, machine learning, and deep learning techniques. By leveraging historical stock data and engineered features, we aim to build predictive models that can provide insights into future stock trends and movements.

Project Objectives
The main objectives of this project are:

To predict future stock prices based on historical data.
To compare various models for their accuracy and robustness in price prediction.
To explore the potential of deep learning models like LSTM and GRU for capturing time series patterns in stock data.
Key Features
Data Collection & Preprocessing: The project begins with gathering historical stock data, including Open, Close, High, Low, and Volume, along with additional technical indicators.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Using data visualization to understand stock trends, seasonal patterns, and key correlations.
Modeling: A range of models are implemented to evaluate different prediction methods:
Baseline Models: Moving averages and ARIMA models serve as benchmarks.
Machine Learning Models: Techniques like Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests.
Deep Learning Models: Recurrent neural networks, particularly LSTMs and GRUs, to capture sequential patterns in the data.
Evaluation: Model performance is measured using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and directional accuracy.
